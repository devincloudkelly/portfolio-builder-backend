# Portfolio Builder Lite

Hello! This is the github repo for the server-side of Portfolio Builder Lite.

* As a user, you can:
    sign in with your current email or create a new user account
    view, create and edit items in your portfolio
    view your finalyzed portfolio!

* After your portfolio is created, the link can be shared without a user needing to login. So your portfolio/resume can be seen by an employer directly without hassle.

## Why We Made This ##
Working in a group collaborative effort, we wanted to fully exercise our understanding of ReactJS and Routing. We wanted to create something that would allow all team members to gain important experience with async behaviors, controlled forms, CSS, etc, while also providing a potentially useful product.
It is our hope to host this so that people (not just those in technical fields), will be able to use it to quickly generate a resume to show a prospective employer.
